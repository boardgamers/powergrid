# Power Grid AI — resumed 23 October 2026

The user explicitly requested “resume powergrid trainnig”. The existing goal is
active. HF Jobs are authorized for training and evaluation. No candidate has
passed the full strength gate, and no AI has been published to production.
This document supersedes the pause instruction in the
[10 October handoff](HANDOFF-2026-10-10-PAUSED.md), which retains the earlier history.

## Workspace and authoritative records

- Research checkout: `/home/eliheros/Documents/Codex/2026-09-26/je-x20-2/work/powergrid-ai`.
- Branch: `ai/germany-baseline`, remote `git@github.com:boardgamers/powergrid`.
- Interpreter: `ai/.venv/bin/python`. Use cached HF and SSH authentication;
  never print tokens or include them in documents, source archives or Git.
- Artifact repo: `coyotte508/powergrid-ai-germany-v1` (private).
- Source dataset: `coyotte508/powergrid-ai-training-v1`.
- Target: `ssh minipc`, AMD 8840U. The local HX370 is not the target benchmark.
- Latest explicit job snapshot:
  [resume-2026-10-23-status.json](strong/resume-2026-10-23-status.json).
  Read its timestamps and inspect those exact handles; do not infer current
  state from this document. Local launch guards are under
  `ai/runs/strategic-teacher-training-launches-v1/`.
- Production/UI checkout remains separate. Do not merge or publish research
  there as part of resuming training. Do not comment on GitHub issues.

## Recovered evidence

No HF jobs were active at resume. All intended jobs left at the pause completed.
The three old image-pull errors already have completed replacement jobs and
must not be retried again. Recovered raw artifacts are pinned to model-repo
revision `7240a51338ba19cc47c437c955a61bb46f1ea70e`.

1. All 20 teacher pilot shards are independently verified: 240 roots with both
   continuation modes, 230,592 full counterfactual rollouts, no caps. The
   independent-batch validation diagnostic is +0.0743 mean paired advantage
   selecting on A/evaluating on B, and +0.0732 in reverse, with 65.8% agreement.
   These are conditional simulation diagnostics, not whole-game strength.
2. The full collection is verified and merged: 3,840 unique games, 7,680 twin
   executions and 200,775 public decision states. All 12 remaining 4–6p geographic
   search slices were checked, and original records and indices preserved.
   This collection contains more states than the fixed 1,920-root label design;
   do not silently change the selected roots or train/validation split.
3. All three 6p guided-search comparisons are verified: 192 games per model,
   eight paired deals with every seat and all four rule combinations. Every
   model lost 9.375 percentage points relative to its raw policy; the paired
   deal 95% interval is [-17.1875,-1.5625] points. Guided search remains unqualified.
   Preserve the earlier 5p Recharged/open regression as well.

- `strong/multiplayer-search-transfer-results-v1.json`

## Work resumed

All 140 remaining teacher shards (deals 2–16) were submitted using the original
guarded launcher. Each of the seven 20-job batches covers 2–6 players, both root
sources and both continuation modes. Exact handles and timeouts are saved in
the status snapshot and launch guards. The first full snapshot had 67 running,
72 scheduling and one completed; this is historical, not a live count.

At the resumption checkpoint, 30/160 shards are independently verified, totaling
345,696 full simulated rollouts. There are still 240 roots with both complete
continuation modes. The faster economic-opponent jobs finishing first does not
make the partial dataset ready for gradients.

These are CPU simulation jobs, using 24 engine workers and single-thread FP64
ONNX inference. The lighter CPU image checks batching parity on all 2,553
serving fixtures before generating labels. Each shard retains 48 independent
worlds per A/B batch and the full 2,400-step continuation horizon. Runtime
admission uses all 20 verified pilots, twice the slowest matching root and 25%
timeout headroom. Timeouts are 4h or 5h; do not shorten games or samples to fit.

Frozen teacher source:

- Roots SHA256: `f0fd62b4dd75c6b6c0936adeb1ffc75a2747cb2c62debe6b5d0aba60dbb4a091`

Never edit those frozen overlays. Preserve errors and ambiguous launch intents.
Inspect exact existing handles before any retry; never treat a delayed tool
response or absence of artifacts as evidence that a job did not start.

## Next training stage

The design remains `strong/strategic-correction-design-v1.json`: freeze the
complete discard-correction 10102 parent and train a 97,473-parameter head on
paired advantages for nominations, bids and building. All other decisions and
the value head remain unchanged. The exact public shortlist plus the parent
proposal is used; the fixed margin is 0.025. Seeds 11101/11102 are fixed before
gradients. Keep negative and uncertain evidence and whole-deal data splits.

New source builder and launcher:

```bash
ai/.venv/bin/python ai/strong/build-strategic-correction-source.py
ai/.venv/bin/python ai/strong/launch-strategic-correction.py
```

The builder rejects incomplete manifests before upload. It preserves the
teacher engine, parent and base features byte-for-byte, overlays only explicit
correction/serving files, checks all 1,920 roots, and uploads an immutable source
archive. The launcher requires that full source/data check and an exclusive
launch guard before submitting one L4 GPU job for both seeds. Supply the cached
token through the environment only. No strategic gradient job has started yet.

Code-only checks use `build-strategic-correction-source.py --code-only` and
never upload a training source or admit training. The zero correction passed
strict parent/ONNX checks on 2,553 positions. The arena whitelist now recognizes
feature revision 4.3 at all player counts. A separate 160-game plumbing check
passed across 2–6 players: every complete game record was identical between
zero correction and parent. Evidence is in
`strong/strategic-correction-source-code-preflight-v1.json`.

The trainable parent is pinned to model-repo revision
`b115a2d78aae095e51fb72a5535b3507abdf90c0`,
`runs/discard-correction-v1/10102/best.pt`, SHA256
`66a10b831a54843063bbca89743a542ed1f89515a16452a40483eef369c59bd8`.
Its serving ONNX SHA256 is
`57f8255e79b991ba466f91e953d0bca6868144bb543577fc0dad8ade387ebf68`.

## Ordered continuation

1. Inspect submitted jobs and collect completed teacher shards at an immutable
   artifact revision with `collect-strategic-teacher-training.py N FAMILY MODE
   START END REVISION`. Existing verified folders should be retained, not
   overwritten. Reconcile any partial folder before retrying collection.
2. Run `summarize-strategic-teacher-training.py`. Require 160 verified shards,
   1,920 complete-mixture roots,1,440 train/480 validation, and no caps. Freeze
   the complete manifest; do not train from a convenient partial subset.
3. Build/check the frozen training source and launch the HF GPU job. Collect
   both seeds, verify frozen parent tensors, epoch selection, strict exports,
   legal responses and source/data hashes independently.
4. Implement/run the fresh development protocol fixed in
   `strong/strategic-correction-screen-protocol-v1.json`: 20,160 games across
   parent and both seeds, 27 count/opponent cells, all four rules and every seat.
   Economic/search opponents, capacity behavior at 2p and frozen A260 at 3p are
   primary diagnostics; legacy/heuristic/rush are included. No development
   games have been run for this protocol yet. Freeze the exact model manifests
   and evaluation source, verify runtime, then submit bounded full-game shards.
5. Report absolute strength and paired gains, including adverse cells. The
   reserved `final-protocol-multiplayer.json` remains unchanged and unused.
   No training-target result or small diagnostic substitutes for that gate.
6. Benchmark the exact selected model/configuration on the actual 8840U and
   verify the extracted standalone serving package before any deployment.

Scope remains Germany, automatic setup, 2–6 players, original/Recharged and
open/sealed auctions. All players' money is allowed. Hidden deck order, random
seeds, submitted sealed bids and queued plans stay excluded. Other maps and
calibrated round-by-round value analysis remain future work.
